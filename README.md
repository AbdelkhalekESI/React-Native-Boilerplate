## React-Native-Boilerplate

This project is a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) boilerplate that can be used to kickstart a mobile application.

The boilerplate provides **an architecture optimized for building solid cross-platform mobile applications** through separation of concerns between the UI and business logic. It is extremely documented so that each piece of code that lands in your application can be understood and used.

```
If you find this boilerplate useful then please give the repository a star
